MineStation13
=============

A Minecraft mod intended to replicate the popular BYOND game, Space Station 13.

A while ago I tried to remake Space Station 13 in Minecraft. Then I forgot about it and did some other stuff. I've decided to throw the little bit I got done on github and see if I can make any more progress on it.

This is what I got done:
* Basic Atmospherics
* Hacking
* Station hull blocks
* Floor Tile Blocks
* Lightbulb Block (Reskinned torch)
* Reskinned Ladder Block
* Customized inventory
* Id Cards
* Dragging Entities
* Airlocks
* Asteroid Dimension with Ores
* Beggining stages of a damage system
